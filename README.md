# Embedded Systems Design I 
Written in C++ using Keil IDE
## BlinkerISR: A Simple FSM using Interrupts
Implementation of an FSM cycling through different blinking states for leds. 
## Reaction-Time Tester
Design of reaction-time tester, which calculates and displays results on an LCD. The tester records both the most recent and best times, also has a debounced external switch permitting for the resetting of the LCD screen and times. 

To use this code, [BSP](https://os.mbed.com/teams/Embedded-System-Design-with-ARM-Cortex-M/code/BSP_DISCO_F429ZI/) and LCD libraries must be added to Keil Studio.
